3. Contrast and typography, I used multiple fonts and fun background colors to get the attention of the readers. Everything is also organized in groups or sections so that it would be easy to navigate and read. I added multiple photos and even a video of our cat because cat lovers would enjoy this for sure.

4. Operable and understandable, nav bars are working fine. The form is also working as long as the the conditions are met for the inputs. Texts are readable Perceivable, I added multiple photos with its corresponding alts making this website easier to view and unique. It can also work in mobile or desktop view. 

5. I used keywords in the Meta tags - I used niche(long tail words) and basic keywords to cater both high and low volumes. I have also included langugage, appropriate title and relevant content matching my keywords. Some of my headers are keyword-rich phrases.
