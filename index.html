                    My parents moved to Canada to pursue a better life for me. I am a Calico domestic short hair that is very active especially at night when everyone is asleep! 
                    Here is a video of me when I finally got here in our new home in Canada. I am scared of new people that is why I seldom go out of our room. Sometimes when our housemates are gone, I sneak out and play a little downstairs! I am scared of most things, 
                    but my dad is a lot scared of me muhahaha.  So far I am loving here in Canada compared to the Philippines, I like the sun here better I dont know why. Sometimes when we go for a walk, I see squirrels or rabbits. I want to chase them and show my 
                    my true power! Kidding, I just want to say hi to them but they always run away. But who wouldnt be scared of me right? Im one tough pussy cat *purr* Sometimes when I am bored I bite my dad's slippers or shoes just for fun. Hmmm maybe i will do it now. Be 
                    right back! My parents always takes a picture of me when I am doing my favorite seating position, check my pictures below for your reference. I call it the asian squat! Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting

                        <h3>Calico cat history</h3>
                        <p>
                          For argument's sake, we’re going to say we think they originated from Egypt around 2000 BCE. This means they rubbed furry shoulders with the Phaeros! However, there are sources detecting the clever calico cat in other Mediterranean countries at a similar time. But why? Are they secretly amazing swimmers? No. 
                          Considered to be lucky in several cultures, calico kittens were often used as sea cats on merchant boats. The furry sailors would be taken around along the trade routes of the Mediterranean, such as Turkey, Greece, Italy, Spain, even Israel! As expert mousers, they could choose to swap their pirate lives for one of privacy on the coast to rest their paws.

                      <h3>Calico cat quick fire facts</h3>
                      <ol>
                          <li>99.9% of calico cats are female: This genetic mutation correlates with the calico cats gender.</li>
                          <li>All male calico cats are born sterile: As male calicos are a mutation of the calico coloring, they are very rare. If found, they are born sterile and sadly have a shorter life expectancy than female calicos.</li>
                          <li>The calico cat is the national cat of Maryland, USA: In October 2001, Maryland declared the calico cat as its official state cat! Why? Well, have you seen them?!</li>
                          <li>Irish folk law believes they can cure warts: Seriously. The Irish also consider calico cats to be lucky. Legend has it, if you’re inflicted with a wart, rubbing against the nearest calico kitten will cure it….</li>
                          <li>Japanese Beckoning cats are calico cats: Like the Irish and Americans, the Japanese also see the calico cat breeds as being lucky. If you’ve ever seen those waving cat figurines outside of Japanese houses or cafes, these are considered to bring good fortune to everyone inside.</li>
                      </ol>
                      <h3 id="grooming">Grooming a Calico cat</h3>
                      <p>British and American shorthair calico cats will require minimal grooming. A brush every now and again, particularly during shedding seasons in Spring and Fall, is more than enough.
                        However, for the owners of longhaired calico kittens, at least a weekly brushing will be required to maintain their lion locks. If your calico kitty is prone to outdoor adventures, 
                        you may even need to consider professional grooming once or twice a year.
